Installation and Setup Guide

Before running the GUI, a few Python packages need to be installed to ensure smooth communication and display functionality.
Follow the steps below carefully.

Required Packages

Run these commands in your command prompt or terminal in the given order:

pip install PyQt5
pip install pyserial
pip install PyOpenGL
pip install numpy


Alternatively, all packages can be installed at once using:

pip install PyQt5 pyserial PyOpenGL numpy

Purpose of Each Package
Package	Description
PyQt5	Provides the framework for all GUI windows and widgets used in the project.
pyserial	Enables serial communication between the Arduino and the GUI through COM ports.
PyOpenGL	Handles 3D rendering tasks such as visualizing components in DISPLAY.py.
numpy	Used for mathematical operations and required as a dependency for PyOpenGL.
Quick Setup Steps

Check Python Installation
Open the command prompt or terminal and type:

python --version


Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Open the Project Directory
Navigate to the folder where your GUI project files are stored:

cd path/to/your/project/folder


Install All Dependencies
Run the installation command:

pip install PyQt5 pyserial PyOpenGL numpy


Launch the Application
Once the installations are complete, start the main GUI using:

python layout.py

Common Installation Issues
Issue	Solution
pip not found	Use pip3 instead of pip on some systems.
Permission denied	Add --user to the command:
pip install --user PyQt5 pyserial PyOpenGL numpy
Font or resource warnings	These are safe to ignore; the GUI will load default fonts automatically.
No COM ports detected	Check that the Arduino is properly connected and that drivers are installed.
